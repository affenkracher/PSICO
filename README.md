# PISCO

_**P**rogram for **S**urveillance, **I**ndoctrination and **C**ivilian **O**ptimization_

This project is created as part of the 'Software Engineering' lecture in summer semester 2022 in the Applied Computer Science course at DHBW Mannheim. The aim is to develop a tool that helps an imaginary territorial state to spy on and influence its people in their most private sphere, on their own computer.

The project consists of two programs. One is the spy program, which is supposed to run on the computers of the citizens of the imaginary regime and collect data about the keystrokes, the mouse position, the camera and about the microphone, for example. There are also penalties, such as a keyboard lock and word correction if a word is written that is on a blacklist. Pop-ups with propaganda slogans are regularly displayed or matching songs are played to influence citizens' minds.

The second program is for administrators only, for example, for selected "government employees". With this program all collected data from computers with the spy program should be accessible.
